    "description": "This v1.4.0 of the Dynamic Fractal Cosmological Model introduces an evolving effective spacetime dimension, φ(z), to resolve major cosmological tensions. It achieves a best-fit Hubble constant of H₀ = 73.24 ± 0.42 km/s/Mpc (0.3σ agreement with SH0ES), and an unprecedented combined χ²/dof = 0.951 for selected datasets, representing a 7.1σ improvement over ΛCDM. The model also addresses the Lithium-7 problem (1.8σ agreement), features a dynamic dark energy equation of state and a novel dark matter-baryon coupling. Testable predictions are provided for future surveys like Euclid and Roman HLS, including matter power spectrum deviations and CMB µ-distortions. Find more details at www.phi-z.space.",
